Through a combination of innovative intervention strategies, including the Microaggression Captcha, Microaggression Garden, and Microaggression Phone Booth, individuals were empowered with tools and awareness to effectively tackle microaggressions. The project also involved the development and management of the MicroAggression (MA) website, an online platform providing valuable resources and educational materials on microaggressions. As a collaborative effort, the team organized and conducted MicroAggression workshops, offering participants insights into microaggressions and equipping them with the skills to foster positive change. Together, these endeavors contributed to creating a more inclusive environment and promoting understanding and respect among individuals.
