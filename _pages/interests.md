## Birding & Wildlife Photography

I'm passionate about capturing wildlife through photography. I've been birding since middle school and love discovering new species through my camera lens. Sometimes I photograph other animals too, like chipmunks, lizards, and snakes.

Here are some photos of birds I took after moving to New York City.

## Writing

I'm a big fan of literature and deeply influenced by Western writers who dedicate themselves to exploring humanity and the complexities of self-understanding. Authors like Gabriel García Márquez, Hermann Hesse, and Albert Camus have shaped my perspective on writing and life. Their works, such as*One Hundred Years of Solitude*, *Siddhartha*, and *The Stranger*, explore profound questions about existence, identity, and what it means to be human. My own writing is heavily impacted by their work.


- **[A Random Walk in Spring](/blog/2025/spring-in-new-york/)** - I wrote this Chinese prose about wandering in Central Park on a random spring day.

## Music

When I'm not working, you'll usually find me buried in music: alternative rock, post-rock, and indie on repeat, with R&B, hip hop, jazz, and anime soundtracks filling in the rest. Recently, I’ve been listening to a lot of Benson Boone.

## Other Interests

**Hobbies:** hiking, traveling.

I love exploring new places and meeting new people. The first thing I usually do in a new city is look for a museum. Museums are my favorite way to quickly understand local history and culture. What I enjoy most about traveling is how it teaches me about the people who live there and how they see their own world.
