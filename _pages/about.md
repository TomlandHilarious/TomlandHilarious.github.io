I am **Ruoxuan Li (李若瑄)**, a researcher working at the intersection of cognitive science, data science, and human centered-AI. I am particularly interested in how long-term interactions with large language models (LLMs) and other personalized AI systems shape the way people think about themselves, evaluate their decisions, and decide when to change their behavior.

I completed my B.S. in Cognitive Science (with a minor in Computer Science) at UC San Diego, where I specialized in machine learning and neural networks. I then earned an M.S. in Data Science at Columbia University. Since then, I have worked as a research assistant on multiple research teams at Columbia, collaborating with faculty in psychiatry, psychology, and economics. My research sits between cognitive science, NLP, and HCI. In the long term, I hope to build personalized AI systems that can support people’s metacognition, especially for individuals with diverse cognitive profiles.

Outside of research, I recharge by being outdoors with a camera in hand. I have been birding since middle school and still feel a quiet kind of happiness whenever I spot a new species through the viewfinder. I also enjoy hiking, wandering in cities, and traveling to places that combine good food with interesting conversations.

I always look forward to meeting people who share similar interests or whose work overlaps with mine! Feel free to reach out to me via email!
