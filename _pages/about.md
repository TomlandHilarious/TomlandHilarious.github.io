I am Ruoxuan Li, a passionate and driven individual with a strong academic background. I graduated from UCSD with a degree in Cognitive Science, specializing in machine learning and neural networks. Currently, I am excited to embark on the next chapter of my academic journey as an incoming student for the Master of Science degree in Data Science at Columbia University.

My research interests revolve around Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and computing education. I have worked on  projects related to machine learning, deep learning, and statistical learning. Seeking to deepen my understanding and skills in these fields, I am actively pursuing data science and software development internships, as well as research opportunities.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy and relaxation in various activities. I am an avid hiker, always on the lookout for scenic trails to explore. Birding is another passion of mine, as I find solace in observing and identifying different bird species. I also enjoy traveling to new places, immersing myself in diverse cultures, and expanding my horizons. 

With a thirst for knowledge and a zest for life, I am on a journey to make a positive impact in the fields of data science, machine learning, and beyond.
