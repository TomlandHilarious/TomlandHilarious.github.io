I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined the **New York State Psychiatric Institute** at Columbia University Irving Medical Center as a Research Assistant! I'm leading the development of a portable decoded EEG neurofeedback platform using Muse-S. 

Looking forward to advancing neurotechnology research and working on impactful healthcare applications!
